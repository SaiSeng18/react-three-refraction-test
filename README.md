# React Three Fiber Refraction Experiment

This project is an exploration of refraction effects using React Three Fiber and Three.js. It features a diamond and a glass sphere model to visualize the refraction.

## Technologies Used

- React Three Fiber: A React renderer for Three.js.

- Three.js: A cross-browser JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.

- Leva: A lightweight and customizable React UI controls library.

- React Three-stdlib: A collection of useful tools for use with React Three Fiber.

- React Three Postprocessing: A postprocessing library for React Three Fiber.

- Caustics: Used to simulate the way light interacts with the diamond and glass sphere models.
